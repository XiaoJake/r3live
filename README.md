## Introduction
&emsp;**R3LIVE** is a novel LiDAR-Inertial-Visual sensor fusion framework, which takes advantage of measurement of LiDAR, inertial, and visual sensors to achieve robust and accurate state estimation. R3LIVE is contained of two subsystems, the LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) and visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The LIO subsystem ([FAST-LIO](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO)) takes advantage of the measurement from LiDAR and inertial sensors and builds the geometry structure of (i.e. the position of 3D points) global maps. The VIO subsystem utilizes the data of visual-inertial sensors and renders the map's texture (i.e. the color of 3D points).

    <font color=#a0a0a0 size=2>(a): R3LIVE is able to reconstruct a dense, 3D, RGB-colored point cloud of the traveled environment in real-time. The white path is our traveling trajectory for collecting the data. (b): The mesh reconstructed with our offline utilities. (c): The mesh after textured with the vertex colors, which is rendered by our VIO subsystem</font>

&emsp;**R3LIVE** is developed based on our previous work [R2LIVE](https://github.com/hku-mars/r2live), with careful architecture design and implementation, is a versatile and well-engineered system toward various possible applications, which can not only serve as a SLAM system for real-time robotic applications, but can also reconstruct the dense, precise, RGB-colored 3D maps for applications like surveying and mapping. Moreover, to make R3LIVE more extensible, we develop a series of offline utilities for reconstructing and texturing meshes, which further minimizes the gap between R3LIVE and various of 3D applications such as simulators, video games and etc.
